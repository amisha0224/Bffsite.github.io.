    <p>Hey! I just want to let you know that I am glad to have met you in PU!<br/>
     All the memories that we had together, <br/>
     with having amazing coincidences like same coaching class,<br/>
      to having spent Almost half a day[12 hrs/day] or maybe more if you include 7 hrs of sleep or something, <br/>
      to almost no contacts for weeks together and no meetups for months together, <br/>
      <hr/>WE have SURVIVED them all.<br/>
        Our friendship is much stronger than it ever was before, and it better stay that way [knife].
    <br/> I am proud to call you my BFF! 
    <br/>Love you always! </p><hr/>
